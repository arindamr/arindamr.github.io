        <div class="step" data-x="1920" data-y="0" data-scale="1">
            <h2>Introduction: The Need for a Human-Centric Approach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully automated software issue triage using Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, including the potential for hallucinations, biases, and difficulties in interpreting complex diagnostic outputs.</li>
                <li>A human-in-the-loop approach is proposed to leverage the analytical power of LLMs while retaining the crucial oversight and domain expertise of human engineers.</li>
                <li>This integrated solution aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of software issue triage by combining the strengths of AI and human intelligence.</li>
                <li>The core principle is to have human review and approval at critical junctures in the automated diagnostic process.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3 -->
        <div class="step" data-x="3840" data-y="0" data-scale="1">
            <h2>Architecture Overview: A Modular System</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem Statement Input: Software engineers provide an English language description of the issue.</li>
                <li>LLM Core: This acts as the central orchestrator of the diagnostic process, analysing the problem statement and suggesting actions.</li>
                <li>Tool Registry: A repository containing comprehensive information about available diagnostic tools, including their purpose, capabilities, and usage instructions.</li>
                <li>Execution Engine: Responsible for executing the selected diagnostic tools with the provided parameters and returning their output.</li>
                <li>Output Interpreter: A module that helps the LLM Core understand the results of the tool execution.</li>
                <li>Iterative Cycle: The process involves continuous loops of LLM suggestion and human review/modification until the issue is understood and a resolution is identified.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4 -->
        <div class="step" data-x="5760" data-y="0" data-scale="1">
            <h2>Human-in-the-Loop: Refining the Initial Problem Statement</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The process begins with the engineer providing a problem statement.</li>
                <li>The LLM Core can analyse this statement and suggest enhancements for clarity and completeness, or extract key information.</li>
                <li>Crucially, the enhanced problem statement is presented to a human engineer for review.</li>
                <li>The engineer can then:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assess the LLM's suggestions.</li>
                        <li>Make necessary modifications to correct misinterpretations.</li>
                        <li>Add crucial details missed by the LLM.</li>
                        <li>Rephrase the problem statement based on their initial understanding.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This human review ensures an accurate foundation for subsequent triage steps.</li>

        <div class="step" data-x="7680" data-y="0" data-scale="1">
            <h2>Human-in-the-Loop: Selecting or Substituting Diagnostic Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Based on the refined problem statement, the LLM Core interacts with the Tool Registry.</li>
                <li>The LLM suggests the diagnostic tool it deems most appropriate for the situation.</li>
                <li>However, the LLM does not automatically execute the tool; its suggestion is presented to a human engineer for approval.</li>
                <li>The engineer can then:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Approve the LLM's suggestion.</li>
                        <li>Select an alternative tool from the Tool Registry based on their experience and knowledge.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This human intervention ensures that the chosen tool is the most suitable for diagnosing the issue.</li>

                <li>It effectively leverages the power of LLMs while ensuring crucial human oversight and control at key decision points.</li>
                <li>This collaborative approach combines the efficiency and analytical capabilities of LLMs with the critical thinking, domain expertise, and nuanced understanding of human engineers.</li>
                <li>The result is a promising path towards a more efficient, accurate, and reliable software issue triage process, ultimately improving software quality and development productivity.</li>
